major:
- Create main.py for running the simulation loop
    - Animals should age gradually, then die in a normal distribution centered on their median death age
    - Add events that increase stress (hunger, fights etc)
- Animals need to move gradually over ticks, not teleport
    - Movement speed should be modified by animal quality and terrain
- Create map class
    - Could have a standard map, and the ability to randomly generate maps
- Set up pregnancy effects
    - After certain time, pregnancy = False and create new animal object(s)
    - Amount of energy obtained by food is reduced by a modifier (gotta feed the baby too)
- Eating an object shouldn't automatically delete it, the target's food_value decrease and actor's energy gain should be proportional to the size of them both.


minor:
- Organisms should not be able to occupy the same space as one another
    - If animals are nearby, interact by socialising, fighting or ignoring
- Create fighting method
- Create hunting method
    - Carnivore class might be worth creating, which inherits from animal and is the superclass to carnivore species
- Do the animals need sexualities or should they all be left as bi
- Rotting of a corpse should gradually improve the nutrients available in the surrounding ground
